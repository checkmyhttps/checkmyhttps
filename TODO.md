## TODO:

- External webpage URLs (DeepInspection):
  - Check every external URLs in a webpage;
  - A client side cache should also be implemented. Useful when there are many recurring calls to well known dependencies (jquery, vuejs...), especially as some websites use a lot of external dependencies
- Usability:
  - Add the option to set a custom certificate on the flutter app if the server certificate doesn't work.
