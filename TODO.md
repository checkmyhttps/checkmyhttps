## TODO:

- Whitelist : The goal is to reduce the list of whitelisted websites. Here are the steps:
  - Server: Improve regex to avoid false positives (done);
  - Client & server: Improve API in order to add IP@ of the website. We must keep the fqdn in case of virtual hosting (= several web servers for only one IP@).
- External webpage URLs:
  - Check every external URLs in a webpage;
  - A client side cache should also be implemented. Useful when there are many recurring calls to well known dependencies (jquery, vuejs...), especially as some websites use a lot of external dependencies
- Security:
  - Implement an alternative to the current SSL Pinning. Indeed, this method implies to update every client when the server certificate changes (approximately each year).
