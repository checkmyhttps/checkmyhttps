We have adding a json file directly in the project in order to list all the dependencies of the flutter project, the goal is to be able to check quickly if there are dependencies out of date in
the project.

If you want to reproduce this json file, you should follow this steps : 

### First Step : 
  In order to get all the dependencies of the flutter project, you will have to use this command :  “dart pub deps --json >> output.json”  in the shell of android studio project.

## FAQ

### Why choose Flutter?

This project is mainly maintained by students from ESIEA, and Flutter is part of their training curriculum. Moreover, we still benefit from the cross-platform advantage that the Ionic version offered.

### Can I use it with my own CMH server?

Due to a specificity of the Dart language, the current version of the app only works with servers that have a certificate signed by a CA Root recognized by Mozilla. You may need to modify parts of the code to use it if your organization issues its own certificates.

### What's new in this version?

We have changed the framework and also added signature verification to the app to enhance the security of the checks.
