 *
 * ## Getting Started
 *
 * For more detailed information, you can view our complete documentation at [docs.revenuecat.com](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs).
 * @usage
 * #### 1. Get a RevenueCat API key
 *
 * Log in to the [RevenueCat dashboard](https://app.revenuecat.com) and obtain a free API key for your application.
 *
 * #### 2. Initialize the SDK
 *
 * You should only configure _Purchases_ once (usually on app launch) as soon as your app has a unique user id for your user. This can be when a user logs in if you have accounts or on launch if you can generate a random user identifier.
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  import { Platform } from "@ionic/angular";
 *  import { Purchases } from "@awesome-cordova-plugins/purchases/ngx";
 *
 *  constructor(public platform: Platform, private purchases: Purchases) {
 *      platform.ready().then(() => {
 *          this.purchases.setDebugLogsEnabled(true); // Enable to get debug logs
 *          this.purchases.setup("my_api_key", "my_app_user_id");
 *      }
 *  }
 * ```
 *
 * #### 3. Quickstart
 * Please follow the [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the SDK
 *
 * ### Requirements
 * Requires XCode 11.0+ and minimum target iOS 9.0+
 * This plugin has been tested with cordova-plugin-purchases@
 * @interfaces
 * PurchasesError
 * IntroEligibility
 * UpgradeInfo
 * PurchasesOfferings
 * PurchasesOffering
 * PurchasesPackage
 * PurchasesProduct
 * PurchaserInfo
 * PurchasesEntitlementInfos
 * PurchasesEntitlementInfo
 * PurchasesTransaction
