## LIMITATIONS:

- CMH don't check external links in a webpage (only its URL). It's in the "todo list". When implemented, this capability will be enabled as an option.
- The mobile app will not work with custom CheckMyHTTPS server if its certificate is self-signed or not signed by a mozilla-registered Root CA.
